# GEMINI.md
This project uses Prumo v0.5 with Google Antigravity.

- Follow Lean Progressive Context: smallest sufficient context, progressive expansion, pointer over payload.
- Read ENTRYPOINT.md, prumo.json, and the active Goal before taking any actions.
- Treat Prumo as an external CLI utility available in PATH ('prumo'). Run 'prumo <command>' or 'prumo --help' for project operations and lifecycle. Do not inspect or search for internal framework development source code.
- Test-Driven Development: Every implementation requires exhaustive automated tests (unit, integration, conformance).
- Security First: Zero hardcoded secrets, follow least privilege, audit dependencies and sanitize inputs.
- Clean Architecture: High cohesion, low coupling, modularity, explicit domain boundaries.
- Continuous Documentation: Keep documentation, VitePress site, and CHANGELOG.md synchronized with implementation. The canonical living source is in `docs/bible/`.
- Directory Documentation: Ensure each folder contains a structured README.md.
